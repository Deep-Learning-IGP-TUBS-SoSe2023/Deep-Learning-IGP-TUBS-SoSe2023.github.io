## Dataset
The dataset used in our experiments is [Landslide4Sense](https://github.com/iarai/Landslide4Sense-2022) for semantic segmentation to detect landslides. The 128x128 images are collected from diverse geographical regions and the Landslide4Sense dataset has three splits, training/validation/test, consisting of 3799, 245, and 800 image patches, respectively. Each image patch is a composite of 14 bands that:


- Multispectral data from Sentinel-2: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B9, B10, B11, B12.
- Slope data from ALOS PALSAR: B13.
- Digital elevation model (DEM) from ALOS PALSAR: B14.

The dataset is highly imbalanced with 98% pixels belonging to the background class and 2% belonging to the landslide class. We use 50% of the train data and split it into train, validation and test.

## Model(s)
The models employed are UNet, SegFormer and Swin Transformer based UNet.
